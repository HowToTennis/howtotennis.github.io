    <H1 class="ExplanationTitle">How To Hit The Shots You Learned On The "Shots" Page</H1>
    <h2 class="TitleForeBackHand" style="float:left">Forehands<br>and<br>Backhands</h2>
    <p class="ForehandBackhand">To start off we will talk about ground strokes. The first of the two ground strokes as you know is the forehand. To hit the forehand you first must identify that the ball is going towards our right side if we are right handed and left side if we are left handed. For the remainder of this explanation I will assume that you are right handed and if you are not then you can invert the instructions. Once we know that the ball is going to your forehand then you must setup for it. To do this you turn sideways and raise your racquet at your side in just your right hand with your normal forehand grip. Once you are in this position you move so that you are standing behind the ball and ready to swing. To accomplish the swing you will quickly move the racquet lower and move it forward through the ball then follow all the way through with your arm and bring it back over your left shoulder. Moving onto the backhand you only hit this shot if you see the ball coming to your left hand side. To begin with you switch your grip from your forehand grip to the continental grip. Once you have the correct grip you will position yourself sideways facing the left side and pull your racquet back with both hands on the handle to be beside your face. Once you are in this position you will move to be behind the ball and swing through it in the same way you swing through on a forehand and follow through over your shoulder just like the forehand. After both of these shots you should recover back to the center or slightly offset from the center just behind the baseline.</p>

    <h3 class="TitleVolley" style="float:left">Volleys</h3>
    <p class="VolleysExplain">To hit a volley you will always be in continental grip. You also must be standing at or near the net and you will take a step towards the ball with the oposite leg then the side you are hitting on. For example, if it is a forehand volley you step with the left leg and a backhand would be the right leg. You then push your racquet forward into the ball and stop almost immediately upon collision with the ball.</p>

    <h4 class="TitleOverhead" style="float:left">Overheads</h4>
    <p class="OverheadExplain">An overhead in tennis just like the volley is generally done from the net and uses the continental grip. Differently from the volley the overhead is used when the ball is very high in the air and also you sometimes will let it bounce once. To hit the shot you will position yourself sideways facing to the right hand side and put your racquet behind your head and raise your left arm to point at the ball. You then will reposition yourself to be slightly behind the ball and below it. Once the ball is at around your maximum reach with the racquet you will swing forward at it then snap downwards with your arm and wrist to bring it down and back into the court instead of just hitting it straight. To change exactly where you will hit the ball you can just change the angle at which you are standing as the ball will go where your racquet follows through to and you swing along your shoulder line. This means that by pointing your shoulders towards one part of the court that is where the ball will go.</p>

    <h5 class="TitleApproach" style="float:left">Approach Shots</h5>
    <p class="ApproachExplain">Approach shots are very similar to the forehand and the backhand. This is because an approach shot is just when you hit a forehand or backhand away from your opponent while moving inwards towards the net. This means that you idealy will get a good volley to win the point. To acheive this then you want to hit your shot towards one of the two back corrners to make your opponent run while idealy hitting it as far away from them as possible. You then will follow the ball up to the net and get ready for a volley. Your highest risk is that they will hit the ball down the line and pass you so you also want to recover slightly offset towards the corner you hit the ball to.</p>

    <h6 class="TitleServe" style="float:left">Serve</h6>
    <p class="ServeExplain">As mentioned on the "Shots" page the serve in tennis is the most important shot of them all and to go with it also the hardest and most complex of them all. To keep things simple let's just go over one of the best serves for the deuce side and ad side. For the deuce side that would be the slice wide serve. To do this you will position yourself sideways with your shoulders facing towards the left back corner of the box. While holding continental grip on your racquet you will throw the ball up infront of you and potentially slightly over to the right hand side of your head. You then will bring your racquet back to hold it behind your head as you toss and as the ball comes down you will swing. The swing should collide with the back right side of the ball and curl around it as you snap down and through to finish with your racquet on the left side of your body. This will bring the ball wide on them pulling them off the court and also add slice which will make the ball bounce away from the court as well. This opens the potentiall for you to hit it very far away from them as they are not standing on the court when they receive your serve. Moving onto the ad side serve we will go over the flat body serve. To do this you will once again position yourself in the same way with the same grip except your shoulders will face towards the relative middle of the box or slightly to either side depending on exactly where you want to serve. You will then toss the ball infront of your face slightly further from your body then you did for the deuce side serve. As you swing through on this serve though you want to hit the back middle of the ball so you do not apply spin and snap down on it with your forearm while following through back to your left hand side again. For the second serve you can do the same type of serve on both deuce and ad side serves. The type we will go over is a kick second serve. You want to aim for the middle of the box while tossing the ball slightly behind your head with the same positioning as you would use for the first serve. Once the ball is falling slightly behind your head and too the left or directly over your head you will have to swing very quickly and wrap up over the back of the ball to generate the spin which helps you control it and makes it kick up known as "Top Spin". Successfully doing this will make it much harder for your opponent to attack the ball off of your serve.</p>
